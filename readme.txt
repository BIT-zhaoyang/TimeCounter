You probably have heard that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. I wrote this timer to measure how many hours I spent on my hobby.

This timer provides statistics on daily, two weeks and in total since you start to use this software.

I came up with this idea while I was playing DOTA2 on steam. Steam has the feature showing how many hours you spent on playing a specific games. I don’t know why they provide this feature. I personally consider it as a warning to players don’t get addicted to games but enjoy your life!

I didn't upload my personal records using this toy program. For your curiosity, I can tell you I've spend 715 hours since last April. That's about two and half hours spare time daily.
